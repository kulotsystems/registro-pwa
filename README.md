# Progressive Web Application Code

Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Angular as part of the Startec REGISTRO contact tracing system.

This PWA is used to generate QR Codes for customers wishing to enter establishments who implement this system. The app makes use of local storage to store sign-up information. Data is retained on the device the next time the user wishes to generate a QR code.

A PWA is a fast lightweight cross-platform web application. On mobile devices with browser support for PWA, it is even possible to download the app for offline use. Learn more  [here](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa "Google PWA Training")
